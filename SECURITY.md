# Security

We take security extremely seriously. We do not offer a bug bounty, but always want to hear about potential security issues or ways we can improve the security quality of our open source code and products.

## Reporting Security Issues
To avoid potentially sensitive issues being filed on GitHub, please send an email to [security@openraven.com](mailto:security@openraven.com).
